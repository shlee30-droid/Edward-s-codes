    <h1>03 // POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS: STRUCTURE AND ROOTS</h1>
    <p>In Algebra II, polynomial functions are the bedrock for advanced problem-solving. A polynomial is defined by the form:
        $$P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0$$
        where $n$ is a non-negative integer (the **degree**) and the coefficients ($a_i$) are real numbers.
    </p>
    
    <h2>KEY TERMINOLOGY</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Degree ($n$):** The highest power of $x$. This determines the maximum number of roots and the end behavior.</li>
        <li>**Leading Coefficient ($a_n$):** The coefficient of the term with the highest degree. This heavily influences the graph's direction.</li>
        <li>**Root / Zero:** An $x$-value where $P(x) = 0$. Graphically, these are the $x$-intercepts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ALGEBRA (FTofA)</h2>
    <p>This is the most critical concept: **A polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots in the complex number system.**  This means a cubic polynomial (degree 3) has exactly three roots, which may be real, imaginary, or a combination thereof.</p>

    <div class="math-block">
        <h3>PRACTICE 3.1: DEGREE & ROOTS</h3>
        <p>A polynomial $P(x) = 5x^4 - 2x^3 + 7x - 1$ has a degree of $\mathbf{4}$. Therefore, it must have exactly $\mathbf{4}$ roots.</p>
        <p>What is the leading coefficient? $\mathbf{5}$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>RATIONAL ROOT THEOREM (RRT)</h2>
    <p>The RRT provides a systematic way to find all possible **rational** roots ($\frac{p}{q}$) of a polynomial with integer coefficients. This is crucial when factoring higher-degree polynomials.</p>
    <div class="math-block">
        <h3>THE RRT FORMULA</h3>
        $$\text{Possible Rational Roots} = \frac{\text{Factors of Constant Term } (p)}{\text{Factors of Leading Coefficient } (q)}$$
    </div>

    <div class="math-block">
        <h3>PRACTICE 3.2: APPLYING RRT</h3>
        <p>Consider $P(x) = 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 8x + 3$.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**$p$ (Factors of Constant term 3):** $\pm 1, \pm 3$</li>
            <li>**$q$ (Factors of Leading Coefficient 2):** $\pm 1, \pm 2$</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What are the possible rational roots ($\frac{p}{q}$)? $\mathbf{\pm 1, \pm 3, \pm 1/2, \pm 3/2}$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>THE REMAINDER AND FACTOR THEOREMS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Remainder Theorem:** If a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$, the remainder is $P(c)$. This is used to quickly check if a possible root is a true root.</li>
        <li>**Factor Theorem:** A binomial $(x - c)$ is a factor of the polynomial $P(x)$ if and only if $P(c) = 0$. (i.e., $c$ is a root).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="math-block">
        <h3>PRACTICE 3.3: USING THE FACTOR THEOREM</h3>
        <p>Use the Factor Theorem to determine if $(x - 1)$ is a factor of $P(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 5x - 2$.</p>
        <p>You need to calculate $P(1)$:</p>
        $$P(1) = (1)^3 - 4(1)^2 + 5(1) - 2$$
        $$P(1) = 1 - 4 + 5 - 2 = \mathbf{0}$$
        <p>Since $P(1) = 0$, $\mathbf{(x - 1)}$ is indeed a factor.</p>
