## Category 1: Basic 2×2 Systems - Solving for Variables

These questions test the ability to solve simple systems using elimination or substitution methods.

### Question 1 (q1)
**Prompt:** What is the value of x in the system: 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1?

**Choices:**
- A. 1
- B. 2 ✓
- C. 3
- D. 4

**Correct Answer:** 2

**Explanation:** Adding both equations: (2x + y) + (x - y) = 5 + 1, which gives 3x = 6, so x = 2.

**Hint:** Try using the elimination method by adding the two equations together.

**Tags:** `2x2`, `elimination`, `basic`

---

### Question 2 (q2)
**Prompt:** What is the value of y in the system: 2x + y = 5 and x - y = 1?

**Choices:**
- A. 0
- B. 1 ✓
- C. 2
- D. 3

**Correct Answer:** 1

**Explanation:** After finding x = 2, substitute into the first equation: 2(2) + y = 5, so y = 1.

**Hint:** First solve for x, then substitute back into one of the original equations.

**Tags:** `2x2`, `substitution`, `basic`

---

### Question 5 (q5)
**Prompt:** Solve the system: x + y = 7 and x - y = 3. What is x?

**Choices:**
- A. 3
- B. 4
- C. 5 ✓
- D. 6

**Correct Answer:** 5

**Explanation:** Adding the equations: (x + y) + (x - y) = 7 + 3, which gives 2x = 10, so x = 5.

**Hint:** Use elimination by adding the two equations.

**Tags:** `2x2`, `elimination`, `basic`

---

### Question 6 (q6)
**Prompt:** In the system: x + y = 7 and x - y = 3, what is y?

**Choices:**
- A. 1
- B. 2 ✓
- C. 3
- D. 4

**Correct Answer:** 2

**Explanation:** After finding x = 5, substitute: 5 + y = 7, so y = 2.

**Hint:** Substitute x = 5 into one of the original equations.

**Tags:** `2x2`, `substitution`, `basic`

---

## Category 2: Direct Substitution Problems

Questions where one variable is already given or isolated, testing the ability to substitute directly.

### Question 8 (q8)
**Prompt:** Solve: 3x + 2y = 12 and x = 2. What is y?

**Choices:**
- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 3 ✓
- D. 4

**Correct Answer:** 3

**Explanation:** Substitute x = 2 into the first equation: 3(2) + 2y = 12, so 6 + 2y = 12, thus 2y = 6 and y = 3.

**Hint:** Since x is already given, just substitute it into the first equation.

**Tags:** `substitution`, `basic`

---

## Category 3: Intermediate Elimination Problems

Questions requiring multiplication before elimination, testing more advanced problem-solving skills.

### Question 10 (q10)
**Prompt:** Solve: x + 2y = 10 and 2x - y = 5. What is x?

**Choices:**
- A. 2
- B. 3
- C. 4 ✓
- D. 5

**Correct Answer:** 4

**Explanation:** Multiply the first equation by 2: 2x + 4y = 20. Subtract the second equation: (2x + 4y) - (2x - y) = 20 - 5, giving 5y = 15, so y = 3. Substitute y = 3 into x + 2y = 10: x + 6 = 10, so x = 4.

**Hint:** Try elimination by multiplying the first equation and then subtracting.

**Tags:** `2x2`, `elimination`, `intermediate`

---

## Category 4: Conceptual Understanding - Terminology

Questions testing understanding of key terms and concepts in systems of equations.

### Question 3 (q3)
**Prompt:** A system with no solution is called:

**Choices:**
- A. Consistent
- B. Dependent
- C. Inconsistent ✓
- D. Independent

**Correct Answer:** Inconsistent

**Explanation:** An inconsistent system has no solution because the lines are parallel and never intersect.

**Hint:** Think about what happens when two lines never meet.

**Tags:** `terminology`, `conceptual`

---

### Question 7 (q7)
**Prompt:** Which method involves multiplying equations to eliminate a variable?

**Choices:**
- A. Substitution
- B. Elimination ✓
- C. Graphing
- D. Matrix inversion

**Correct Answer:** Elimination

**Explanation:** The elimination method involves adding or subtracting equations (often after multiplying) to eliminate one variable.

**Hint:** This method gets rid of one variable by combining equations.

**Tags:** `methods`, `terminology`, `conceptual`

---

## Category 5: Geometric Interpretation

Questions about visual/graphical understanding of systems of equations.

### Question 4 (q4)
**Prompt:** What does it mean geometrically when a 2×2 system has infinitely many solutions?

**Choices:**
- A. The lines are parallel
- B. The lines are perpendicular
- C. The lines are identical ✓
- D. The lines intersect at two points

**Correct Answer:** The lines are identical

**Explanation:** When a system has infinitely many solutions, the two equations represent the same line (dependent system).

**Hint:** Consider what happens when two equations describe the exact same line.

**Tags:** `geometric`, `dependent`, `conceptual`

---

### Question 9 (q9)
**Prompt:** For the system: 2x + 3y = 8 and 4x + 6y = 16, how many solutions exist?

**Choices:**
- A. 0
- B. 1
- C. Infinitely many ✓
- D. Cannot determine

**Correct Answer:** Infinitely many

**Explanation:** The second equation is just 2 times the first equation, so they represent the same line (dependent system).

**Hint:** Check if one equation is a multiple of the other.

**Tags:** `dependent`, `geometric`, `conceptual`
