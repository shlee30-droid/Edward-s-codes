I have something called passion project in my school, and we already started.
It's about doing something that is related to our interests.
My passion project is to code a website that explains about math, specifically
algebra and pre-calculus.
here is my first prototype of my website: http://127.0.0.1:5000.
I am going to keep improving this prototype into master-piece.
