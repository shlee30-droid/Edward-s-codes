I am pursuing a passion project at my school that involves creating a website dedicated to mathematics education
with a focus on algebra and pre-calculus concepts. 
The project is currently in its initial prototype phase and is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
I would appreciate feedback from an educator or mentor regarding the website's design
functionalityand educational effectiveness, as well as any recommendations for improvement.
